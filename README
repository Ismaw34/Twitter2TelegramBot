You can reply to tweets using the telegram reply function. (Set the message to reply and then post a new tweet using the /twitter command)

Additionally it has /help command to get all the commands and the /father command to directly copy and paste to the BotFather's /setcommands.

NOTE: Some strings are in Spanish, future version will feature all the strings in English and maybe language selector.

Just redownload the source and apply the AppConfig strings needed and recompile.

How to compile:
Get the sources and all the libs, put the libs on the Java library build path.
Compile using the Java8JDK.
Use the TelegramInstance class as the MainClass.
